    <p>from 1945 to 1995</p>
    <h2>1945</h2>
    <p>Vannevar Bush writes<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/"> an article </a> in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/world/">Atlantic Monthly </a>  about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche</p>
    <h2>1960s</h2>
    <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href="http://www.bootstrap.org/library.htm">Bootstrap Institute library.</a></p>
    <p>Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate. 20th National Conference, New York, <a href="https://www.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.</p>
    <p>Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.</p>
    <h2>1980</h2>
    <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III.
